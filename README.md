# BioNoMo Toolkit
R functions to prepare data for publication in the Biodiversity Network of Mozambique

---

This repo provides R functions and SQL code to prepare the data coming from various providers to be hosted on the Biodiversity Network of Mozambique (BioNoMo). [BioNoMo](http://bionomo.herokuapp.com/en/) is an initiative of the [SECOSUD II Italian Cooperation Project](http://www.secosud2project.com/), and it's aimed at developing a national platform for the collection, organization and sharing of information on biological diversity. BioNoMo is implemented in partnership with the major generators and providers of primary biodiversity data to create a national unified, open portal to research-grade information about biodiversity in Mozambique.
Although most of the functions' behavior is very specific to BioNoMo purposes, anyone is allowed to use this code to create his/her own functions and to redistribute it freely under the terms of the GNU GPL v2.0 (see LICENSE for details).
